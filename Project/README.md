# Instructions

In this multi-task project that will use s-expressions that were defined in previous lectures and labs. We will call the language ciLisp (Channel Islands Lisp), since it is similar to Lisp programming language.  
  
This is a challenging project that requires your focus throughout a span of several weeks. There are eight tasks in the project with progressing level of complexity. The later parts are much more challenging than the initial tasks, so to stay on track and being able to wrap things up you should attempt to implement 1-2 tasks per week in the initial phase of the project. Completing the later tasks may take longer than a week to accomplish.  
  
To implement the compiler, you will use flex (lex) and bison (yacc) that you learned in the previous labs. The implementation will span several stages; each stage will add a feature to the compiler. If you complete all stages (i.e., implement all specified features) then you will get maximum points for the whole project; otherwise, you will earn partial credits according to the number of features that you will have implemented.  
  
At each stage, expand the ciLisp compiler to handle compilation of ciLisp programs utilizing the expanded grammar. Then extend the evaluator of abstract syntax trees so it handles the new features. Write a program in ciLisp that forces both the compiler and the evaluator to thoroughly test the new functionality.
