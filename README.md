## Course Description:
Over the years, numerous programming languages have been designed to encode algorithms and control what computers do. Languages evolved along more or less distinct paths that were addressing different programming needs. There are numerous languages in existence today that can be categorized into several not-necessarily exclusive groups: imperative, structural, object-oriented, functional, logic, scripting, and some other. Being able to select a right language for a programming job at hand is a necessary skill that a computer scientist needs to posses. Understanding how the programmers directives encoded using a programming language are projected onto computer activity is critical in developing robust and efficient code.  
  
In this course, students will study the design, implementation, and use of high-level programming languages. The topics will include the historical background, how languages reflect different design philosophies and user requirements, and technical issues in the design of major programming languages.

## Student Outcomes
After successfully completing this course, students will be able to:  
- recognize features distinguishing programming languages,
- select a programming language for a specific task,
- define a new programming language with variables, types, scopes, and procedures, using BNF (Backus-Naur Form) notation,
implement programming language compiler including:
  - a scanner,
  - a parser,
  - a symbol table,
  - a generator of decorated abstract syntax tree (intermediate code),
  - a scoping system,
  - a typing system,
  - a procedure invocation mechanism,
- implement a virtual machine for executing compiled programs (intermediate code),
- master programming in C with standard C libraries and a number of specialized libraries,
- use compiler generating tools flex (lex) and bison (yacc), and
- organize and express ideas concerning programming languages clearly and convincingly in oral and written forms.
